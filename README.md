shit to do:

1. OTP real time too (nah can't for a big cart id have to give all vendors the same OTP)
2. Seller reviews (?)
3. fix vendors
4. new db query for every gemini request that pretty much informs gemini when new stuff comes in or leaves (fix it)
5. recaptcha
6. Cig after sex (cas)
7. redirect to login after reg
8. edit, delete my item

Assumptions:
1. You can buy only one item per Order
2. There's an infinite supply of items, anyone can keep buying again and again (1 every time).
