## Assumptions

- **Infinite Quantity:**  
  There is an infinite quantity of what a user uploads.

- **Cart Management:**  
  A user can add only one instance of a specific item by a user in the cart at a time. They can order it multiple times by placing orders (and hence emptying their cart) multiple times without seller intervention.

- **OTP Generation:**  
  An OTP for safety purposes is only generated after a sale when you click on generate/regenerate OTP on the pending deliveries page. The seller cannot sell until OTP has been generated by the buyer even after the order has been placed.
